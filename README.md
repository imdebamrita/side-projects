## What is SideProjects?

SideProjects is a website that allows you post your dev side projects for the world to find and discover.


You can view other people's side projects, and even like and bookmark them if they catch your fancy!

SideProjects was created using Svelte-kit, shadcn-svelte and Supabase! Really amazing tech.

There's still soooooo many things left to perfect in this application. Contributions are always welcome :-)

(I'll be adding a CONTRIBUTING.md file soon, as well as updating this README.md file).
